# LLM API Integration with Gemini Model

This repository contains my personal implementation and explanation of how to integrate with Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Gemini model API. The implementations are provided in both TypeScript/JavaScript and Python to demonstrate the concepts in different programming languages.

## Repository Structure

- `ts/` - TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- `python/` - Python implementation

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical guide showing how to:
- Set up API connections with the Gemini model.
- Send requests and handle responses.
- Implement various features using the LLM API.
- Compare implementations between TypeScript/JavaScript and Python.

The code is organized to be educational, showing my own approach and understanding of LLM API integration patterns.
